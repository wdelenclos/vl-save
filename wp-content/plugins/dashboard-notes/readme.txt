Easily create notes/instructions in the WordPress admin using any widget you like!

== Description ==
**Did you find this plugin helpful? Please consider [leaving a 5-star review](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/dashboard-notes).**

Dashboard Notes lets you create super simple notes and instructions for your clients within the WordPress dashboard. Choose the color of the notification, whether or not to include a logo, and exactly what pages to include the notification on (uses simple URL matching).

= Usage =
1. Install the Dashboard Notes.
2. Go to Appearance > Widgets where you will see a new "Dashboard Notes" sidebar.
3. To create a note, simply drag a new widget into the sidebar and give it some content (we typically use a text/HTML widget).
4. Once you've added content to the widget, click save, and the Dashboard Notes settings for this widget will appear.
5. Adjust the settings to meet your needs, and click save when you're done.
6. Refresh, or navigate to any page to see your new note in action.
7. Use the plugin settings found via **Settings > Dashboard Notes** to choose which user roles can/can’t see the notices.

1. Dashboard Notes adds a new widget area which can be used to add new notes.
2. Each widget in the Dashboard Notes widget area has a number of settings you can use to customize how and where the note appears (note: you must initially save the widget once for these settings to appear).
3. The final product! Add as many notes as you like.
