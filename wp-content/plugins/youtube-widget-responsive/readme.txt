                or link to uploads video of user
                "list=LMFAOVEVO&listType=user_uploads"
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>list</strong> (supported players: AS3, HTML5)
        <ul>
            <li>
    <p>The list value of link (you can put entire url on video without use this param)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>autohide</strong> (supported players: AS3, HTML5)
        <ul>
            <li>
    <p>Values: 2 (default), 1, and 0. This parameter indicates whether the video controls will automatically hide after a video begins playing. The default behavior (autohide=2) is for the video progress bar to fade out while the player controls (play button, volume control, etc.) remain visible.</p>

    <p>If this parameter is set to 1, then the video progress bar and the player controls will slide out of view a couple of seconds after the video starts playing. They will only reappear if the user moves her mouse over the video player or presses a key on her keyboard.
    If this parameter is set to 0, the video progress bar and the video player controls will be visible throughout the video and in fullscreen.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>autoplay</strong> (supported players: AS3, HTML5)
        <ul>
            <li>
    <p>Values: 0 or 1. Default is 0. Sets whether or not the initial video will autoplay when the player loads.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>mute</strong> (supported players: AS3, HTML5)
        <ul>
            <li>
    <p>Values: 0 or 1. Default is 0. Sets whether or not the video mute when the player loads.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>cc_load</strong> (supported players: AS3)
        <ul>
            <li>
    <p>Values: 1. Default is based on user preference. Setting to 1 will cause closed captions to be shown by default, even if the user has turned captions off.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>cc_lang</strong> (supported players: AS3)
        <ul>

    </li>
    <li><strong>color</strong> (supported players: AS3, HTML5)
        <ul>
            <li>
    <p>This parameter specifies the color that will be used in the player's video progress bar to highlight the amount of the video that the viewer has already seen. Valid parameter values are red and white, and, by default, the player will use the color red in the video progress bar. See the YouTube API blog for more information about color options.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>controls</strong> (supported players: AS3, HTML5)
        <ul>
            <li>
    <p>Values: 0, 1, or 2. Default is 1. This parameter indicates whether the video player controls will display. For IFrame embeds that load a Flash player, it also defines when the controls display in the player as well as when the player will load:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>controls=0 – Player controls do not display in the player. For IFrame embeds, the Flash player loads immediately.</li>
                    <li>controls=1 – Player controls display in the player. For IFrame embeds, the controls display immediately and the Flash player also loads immediately.</li>
                    <li>controls=2 – Player controls display in the player. For IFrame embeds, the controls display and the Flash player loads after the user initiates the video playback.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Spacebar: Play / Pause</li>
                        <li>Arrow Left: Jump back 10% in the current video</li>
                        <li>Arrow Right: Jump ahead 10% in the current video</li>

    </li>
    <li><strong>allowfullscreen</strong>  (supported players: AS3)
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Values: 0 or 1. The default value is 1, which causes the fullscreen button to display. Setting this parameter to 0 prevents the fullscreen button from displaying.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>loop</strong>  (supported players: HTML5, AS3)
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Values: 0 or 1. The default value is 0. In the case of a single video player, a setting of 1 causes the player to play the initial video again and again. In the case of a playlist player (or custom player), the player plays the entire playlist and then starts again at the first video.</p>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>iv_load_policy</strong> (supported players: AS3, HTML5)
        <ul>
            <li>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>modestbranding</strong> (supported players: AS3, HTML5)
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>This parameter lets you use a YouTube player that does not show a YouTube logo. Set the parameter value to 1 to prevent the YouTube logo from displaying in the control bar. Note that a small YouTube text label will still display in the upper-right corner of a paused video when the user's mouse pointer hovers over the player.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>suggested</strong>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Values: 0 or 1. The parameter's default value is 1. If you set the parameter value to 0, then the player will not display information like the video title and uploader before the video starts playing.</p>
                <p>If the player is loading a playlist, and you explicitly set the parameter value to 1, then, upon loading, the player will also display thumbnail images for the videos in the playlist. Note that this functionality is only supported for the AS3 player since that is the only player that can load a playlist.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>theme</strong> (supported players: AS3, HTML5)
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>This parameter indicates whether the embedded player will display player controls (like a play button or volume control) within a dark or light control bar. Valid parameter values are <strong>dark</strong> and <strong>light</strong>, and, by default, the player will display player controls using the dark theme. </p>
